# Personal-VSH-XMB-mods
My personal VSH/XMB mods. Dont install SPRXs on PS3HEN.

# How to install

mmOS can be a bit finiky, so dont just copy the folder into 
dev_blind/vsh/resource, just copy the files/folders and scroll down 
to a blank space.

Mount dev_flash as dev_blind in multiMAN: Open multiMAN and scroll to the left 
until you get to the settings tab. 
Press DPAD UP once to land on "Mount dev_flash with write permissions in mmOS"
Next, pres SELECT+START until you see a desktop-like environment. 
Now, select dev_blind. **DO NOT SELECT DEV_FLASH, IT WILL NOT COPY FILES**
Once your in dev_blind, you should see a folder at the bottom named vsh.
Click on that, and select resource. now, go to your USB and select the classic style
folder, and navigate to vsh/resource. Now press Circle on all the files, and then 
press X. Now select Copy. Go back to the dev_blind window, and scroll down until you
see a blank area, press circle in the blank area, and select Paste. Wait for it
to copy, and go back to your USB. Now go back one folder, and into the module folder.
Your gonna need to just select the single file with Circle, then navigate to the same 
folder in the dev_blind window. the path needs to be dev_blind/vsh/module. once you
are there, scroll down until you see a clear space, and press circle, then Paste.
Now, once it is done you can reboot the console.

That should be about it! 
Enjoy this classic and timeless PS3 modification.
